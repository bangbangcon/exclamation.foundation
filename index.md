Exclamation Foundation is the organizing body behind !!Con.

## [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com)

!!Con (pronounced “bang bang con”) is two days of ten-minute talks (with lots of breaks, of course!) to celebrate the joyous, exciting, and surprising moments in computing. !!Con takes place in NYC, usually in early may. It has run every year since 2014.

## [!!Con West](http://bangbangcon.com/west)

!!Con West is the west-coast version of !!Con and takes place in Santa Cruz, CA. The first one took place in 2019.

## About !F

Exclamation Foundation, est. 2019, is a corporation established for running !!Con and !!Con West. Previously, the organizers used a corporation called "Bang Bang Corn, LLC" because _someone_ made a typo when registering the domain name. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
