Exclamation Foundation was the organizing body behind !!Con.

## [!!Con](https://bangbangcon.com)

!!Con (pronounced “bang bang con”) was two days of ten-minute talks (with lots of breaks, of course!) to celebrate the joyous, exciting, and surprising moments in computing. From [2014](https://bangbangcon.com/2014) to [2019](https://bangbangcon.com/2019), !!Con took place in NYC. It took place online from [2020](https://bangbangcon.com/2020) through [2022](https://bangbangcon.com/2022), and took place in Santa Cruz, California in [2024](https://bangbangcon.com).

## [!!Con West](https://bangbangcon.com/west)

!!Con West, the west-coast edition of !!Con, took place in Santa Cruz, CA in [2019](https://bangbangcon.com/west/2019) and [2020](https://bangbangcon.com/west/).

## About !F

Exclamation Foundation, est. 2019, was a nonprofit entity established for running !!Con and !!Con West. Previously, the organizers used a corporation called "Bang Bang Corn, LLC" (yes, "corn" - it's a long story).

The foundation ran until 2025, when it was dissolved after the final !!con.
